excerpt: 'Machine learning is bantered around in the media often these days, many times erroneously. The key question that concerns auditors is not how to build machine learning algorithms or how to debate on the relative merits between L1 and L2 regularization, but rather, in what context is the algorithm operating within the business? Additionally, do we have assurance that it meets all regulatory and business constraints and fulfills the needs of the enterprise?'

Machine learning is bantered around in the media often these days, many times erroneously. The key question that concerns auditors is not how to build machine learning algorithms or how to debate on the relative merits between L1 and L2 regularization, but rather, in what context is the algorithm operating within the business? Additionally, do we have assurance that it meets all regulatory and business constraints and fulfills the needs of the enterprise?
