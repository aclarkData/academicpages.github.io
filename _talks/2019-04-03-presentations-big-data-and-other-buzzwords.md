With so much noise and buzzwords floating around regarding data analytics, it can be rather difficult to decipher between the signal (what is worthwhile) and what is only talk. Sometimes the rhetoric even starts within your organization, confounding the issue further. During Andrewâ€™s session, he will provide attendees with the knowledge they need to tune out the bogus information while gleaning valuable insights for developing and deploying their audit analytics program. The presentation will conclude with tangible examples of a successful Manufacturing Audit Analytics program, and recommendations for how to get yours up and running. After attending, participants will be able to articulate how steps for setting up an analytics program within their departments, as well be armed with knowledge for educating senior leadership on the fundamental changes in technology that are occurring, and what is just marketing.
