Machine learning has evolved past an esoteric technique worked on by academics and research institutes into a viable technology being deployed at many companies. Machine learning has been significantly changing the competitive landscape of business models worldwide, contributing to the demise of established business, such as Blockbuster, to creating entirely new businesses, such as algorithmic advertising. This presentation strives to address the questions of what assurance professionals need to know about this technology and how to provide assurance around machine learning implementations and its unique risks.
