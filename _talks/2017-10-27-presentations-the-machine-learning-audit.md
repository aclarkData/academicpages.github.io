As it gains wider adoption, what does machine learning mean for internal auditors and their organizations? With the proliferation of buzzwords and the black box nature of machine learning, Mr. Clark will help you cut through the noise and understand what fundamental changes are occurring and what is still more hype than reality. The session will include an overview of what machine learning is, examine its current and potential impact on industries and organizations, and explain the need for an objective audit. The presentation will conclude with an example of what a machine learning audit would consist of, and what steps would be required to perform one.
