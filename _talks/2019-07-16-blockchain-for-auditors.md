â€‹Blockchain is a revolutionary technology for some industries and applications, however it is commonly misunderstand and confused with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Blockchain is the underlying technology that makes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies possible, but it can be used for much more than cryptocurrencies alone. This presentation explains what Blockchain is, how it works and expounds on the uses of blockchain technology outside of cryptocurrencies in order to equip IT auditors with the knowledge they need to advise their companies on blockchain implementations. Blockchain has several very real uses cases, such as in logistics and financial payments clearing, however there is a lot of misleading or false information out there. The basics between what a public and private blockchain is, how the chain operates, what are miners, what security considerations exist, etc. will be discussed, along with an overview of how to audit this technology.
